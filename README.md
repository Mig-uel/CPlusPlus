<h3>Programming Challenges</h3>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Miles per Gallon</b><br><br>
      Write a program that calculates a car's gas mileage. The program should ask the user
      to enter the number of gallons of gas the car can hold and the number of miles it can be
      driven on a full tank . It should then calculate and display the number of miles per
      gallon the car gets.<br><br>

    <b>Stadium Seating</b><br><br>
     There are three seating categories at a stadium . For a softball game, Class A seats cost
     $15, Class B seats cost $12, and Class C seats cost $9. Write a program that asks how
     many tickets for each class of seats were sold, then displays the amount of income
     generated from ticket sales. Format your dollar amount in a fixed-point notation with
     two decimal points and make sure the decimal point is always displayed.<br><br>

    <b>Housing Costs</b><br><br>
     Write a program that asks the user to enter their monthly costs for each of the following
     housing-related expenses:
     • rent or mortgage payment • phones

    <b>How Much Insurance?</b><br><br>
     Many financial experts advise property owners to insure their homes or buildings for
     at least 80 percent of the amount it would cost to replace the structure. Write a program
     that asks the user to enter the replacement cost of a building and then displays the
     minimum amount of insurance that should be purchased for the property . <br><br>

    <b>Batting Average</b><br><br>
     Write a program to find a baseball player's batting average . The program should ask
     the user to enter the number of times the player was at bat and the number of hits
     earned. It should then display the batting average to four decimal places. <br><br>

    <b>Average Rainfall</b><br><br>
     Write a program that calculates the average monthly rainfall for three months. The
     program should ask the user to enter the name of each month, such as June or July, and
     the amoun t of rain (in inches) that fell that month. The program should display a
     message similar to the following:
     The average monthly rainfall for June, July, and August was 6.72 inches. <br><br>

  <li>
    <b>Male and Female Percentages</b><br><br>
     Write a program that asks the user for the number of males and the number of females
     registered in a class. The program should compute and report what percentage of the
     student s are males and what percentage are females. Display the output with two
     decimal points. If you remembered to convert the decimal result of each calculation to
     percent form when you displayed it, the two values should add up to 100.00 percent. <br><br>

    <b>Vacation Days</b><br><br>
     Write a program that prompts the users to enter the number of days they plan to spend
     on their next vacation. Then compute and report how long that is in hours, in minutes,
     and in seconds. <br><br>

    <b>Box Office</b><br><br>
     A movie theater only keeps 80 percent of the revenue earned from ticket sales. The other
     20 percent goes to the distibutor. Write a program that calculates a theater's gross and
     net box office revenue for a night. The program should ask for the name of the movie,
     and how many adult and child tickets were sold. (The price of an adult ticket is $10 and
     a child's ticket is $6.) It should display a report similar to the following:<br><br>
    <b>Movie Name:</b> "Wheel of Fury"<br>
    <b>Adult Tickets Sold:</b>  382<br>
    <b>Child Tickets Sold:</b> 127<br>
    <b>Gross Box Office Revenue:</b> $ 4582.00<br>
    <b>Amount Paid to Distributor:</b> - $ 916.40 <br>
    <b>Net Box Office Revenue:</b> $ 3665.60 <br><br>

    <b>How Many Widgets?</b><br><br>
     The Yukon Widget Company manufactures widgets that weigh 12.5 pounds each .
     Write a program that calculates how many widgets are stacked on a pallet, based on
     the total weight of the pallet. The program should ask the user how much the pallet
     weighs by itself and with the widgets stacked on it. It should then calculate and display
     the number of widgets stacked on the pallet. <br><br>

    <b>How Many Calories?</b><br><br>
     A bag of cookies holds 30 cookies. The calorie information on the bag claims that
     there are 10 "servings" in the bag and that a serving equals 240 calories. Write a
     program that asks the user to input how many cookies they actually ate and then
     reports how many total calories were consumed . <br><br>

    <b>Ingredients Adjuster</b><br><br>
     A cookie recipe calls for the following ingredients:<br><br>
     • 1.5 cups of sugar<br>
     • 1 cup of butter<br>
     • 2. 75 cups of flour<br><br>
     The recipe produces 48 cookies with these amounts of the ingredients. Write a program
     that asks the user how many cookies he or she wants to make and then displays the
     number of cups of each ingredient needed for the specified number of cookies.  <br><br>

    <b>Celsius to Fahrenheit</b><br><br>
     Celsius to Fahrenheit
         Write a program that converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit temperatures . The
         formula is<br><br>
         F = 9/5C + 32 <br><br>
         where F is the Fahrenheit temperature and C is the Celsius temperature. The program
         should prompt the user to input a Celsius temperature and should display the
         corresponding Farenheit temperature. <br><br>

    <b>Currency</b><br><br>
     Write a program that will convert U.S. dollar amounts to Japanese yen and to euros,
     storing the conversion factors in the constant variab les YEN_PER_DOLLAR and
     EUROS_PER_DOLLAR. To get the most up-to-date exchange rates, search the Internet
     using the term "currency exchange rate" or "currency converter." If you cannot find
     the most recent exchange rates, use the following:<br><br>
     1 Dollar= 120.005 Yen
     1 Dollar= .881 Euros <br><br>
